if you install eclipse-juno here is how to "Scala enable" it:
	URL for nightly builds is:
	http://scala-ide.org/download/nightly.html
	URL for the update site is:
	http://download.scala-ide.org/nightly-scala-ide-juno-210x
	You need the nightly builds for Eclipse Juno (4.2)...
	You will also need more heap size from Eclipse for Scala.
	You can find info here:
	http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F
	My scrtip (eclipse_scala.sh) already passed a parameter for making the heap size larger to eclipse.

another option is to download a scala pre-made eclipse IDE from typesafe.com:

Official sdk is at:
